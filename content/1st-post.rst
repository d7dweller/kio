:summary: This is the first post of many detailing my learning through Linux, python, and various security related dealings.


Welcome to my new site!
=======================

I finally decided to quit passing time and actually get around to creating/deploying my webpage.

Here I will try to outline various processes for installing/using/troubleshooting various aspects of Linux systems, though most of it will be heavily based from an Administrator's perspective.

Additionally, things may change fairly frequently, as this site is currently under active development.

I hope you enjoy your stay. Leave feedback as much as much as you'd like.
